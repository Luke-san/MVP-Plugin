# MVP Plugin

Announces MVP at the end of match though how many kills they have.

This is a simplistic remake of Joker's <a href="https://github.com/galaxy119/MVP">MVP plugin for Smod</a>, I just remade it into a more simplistic version for EXILED.

Due to issues with having it work with the Exiled Config file, this will be in a custom config file in your AppData\Roaming\Plugins\MVP in a file called "MVP_Config.txt" (if this isn't there run the server once with the plugin and it will create it)

<h3>Parameters</h3>

+ MVP_Announcement - Changes the announcement for MVP at the end of the game must include {Kills} for number of kills and {MVP} for the name of the MVP of the round.
+ MVP_NoKill_Announce - This is what is announced at the end of a match if nobody gets any kills.
