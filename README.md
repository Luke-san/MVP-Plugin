# MVP Plugin

Announces MVP at the end of match though how many kills they have.

This is a simplistic remake of Joker's <a href="https://github.com/galaxy119/MVP">MVP plugin for Smod</a>, I just remade it into a more simplistic version for EXILED.

<h3>Parameters</h3>

+ MVP_Announcement - Changes the announcement for MVP at the end of the game must include {Kills} for number of kills and {MVP} for the name of the MVP of the round.
+ MVP_NoKill_Announce - This is what is announced at the end of a match if nobody gets any kills.
